Chris Jacobs, one of the Republicans who voted in favor of the assault weapons ban, felt compelled to not seek reelection after facing backlash for voting in favor of gun control. httpswww.usatoday.comstorynewspolitics20220730congressmembersbrokepartyassaultweaponsban10191151002httpswww.usatoday.comstorynewspolitics20220730congressmembersbrokepartyassaultweaponsban10191151002 I understand that when it comes to being on a federal level legislature, too many dissenting voices can cause unnecessary gridlock for key legislation. **However, I feel like politics these days has given us the choice between two different sandwiches with some unsavory ingredients, and we are rarely given the option of removing or switching ingredients within the sandwich we have to take the sandwich as is. Maybe South Park was right about our only viable political options being a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Its like the two political parties know this and have convinced a lot of people that The worst person in our political party is better than the best person in the other political party.** So should there be more people and politicians willing to publicly disagree with their preferred political party on controversial issues?',\n",

              "  'text': 'Starting in the 1920s the Democratic Partys big tent pole issues revolved around labor rights and support of unions. By the 1960s, successful legislation outlining workers rights, occupational safety standards, a minimum wage and environmental working conditions, had increasingly made that focus feel less urgent, letting civil rights become the predominant issue for the party. Since then, the party has become a coalition of varied interests climate change, reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, etc. and lacks a unifying issue to coalesce the party. This leaves them squabbling over the direction of the party, in every election cycle, with the centrist establishment usually holding sway, while the more progressive members become increasingly dissatisfied and uncooperative with party goals. The Republican Party has changed more from two single inflection points, then through slow modulation over time. The first being Nixons Southern Strategy, which was to employ racist dogwhistle rhetoric to lure traditional Democratic voters in the South, the Dixiecrats, into the Republican fold. Around the same time, they adopted an antiabortion stance which had previously not been a big political issue in order to lure traditionally Democratic Catholic voters into the GOP having the unusual side result of Protestant Christians adopting their views on an issue from their political leaders, rather than the other way around. The second one was Trump. He has remade the Republican Party into the Trump party, and he rules over it in an openly authoritarian manner. The GOP has become more authoritarian in response and hence more cohesive in their voting habits, as demonstrating loyalty to Donald Trump is more important than maintaining a consistent political stance on any given issue. You see this contradiction with Trump spending a decade demeaning and rejecting electric vehicles, then doing a sales advert on the White House South Lawn, pushing electric vehicles. His supporters go along with this, because authoritarian structures demand conformity. Given the very different ideological structure of these two parties, it becomes difficult for them to even have a dialog about policies for the US. One side is inclined to argue, bicker and fight, but also feels obligated to let even the smallest, most marginalized voices be heard even if they then ignore those voices. The other side is beholden to a single authority sitting at the peak of a topdown power structure. Their very understanding of who has power and how to wield it, is diametrically opposed. This makes it difficult for them to even agree on a framework for discussion, let alone a consensus on policy. **TLDR** Republicans value conformity and authority, making it more likely they fall in line to the leaders goals, but also more likely to support bad policy, just to demonstrate loyalty. They also embrace one large issue as uniting currently its immigration. Democrats value inclusion and consensus, making their internal functions more fractious, messy and less likely to arrive at a unifying policy decision. They were more successful when they agreed on one issue being more important than the myriad issues of their voters as they did with Labor and then Civil rights, but less inclusive. Honestly, the Republican approach is more efficient, but also more likely to harm marginalized groups and damage the function of government which is supposed to be a consensus, not just obedience. But the Democrats approach is very difficult to corral into sensible policy goals. The dems would be wise to choose a tent pole issue, like healthcare or wealth inequality, even if it costs them some of their fringe elements.',\n",

It is generally characterized by its nationalist and rightwing populist ideologies. The party advocates for policies that emphasize British sovereignty, immigration control, and a return to traditional values.\\n\\nThe NRP typically focuses on issues such as promoting the interests of British citizens, criticizing the influence of the European Union, and opposing multiculturalism, which they believe undermines national identity. The party has also expressed concerns about social issues, advocating for a strong law and order approach.\\n\\nWhile the NRP aims to resonate with voters who feel disillusioned with mainstream politics, it has faced criticism for its views, which some label as extremist or xenophobic. The partys influence is limited compared to larger political parties, but it represents a segment of the electorate that seeks a more radical departure from the current political landscape.\\n\\nOverall, the National Rebirth Party is part of a broader trend of nationalist movements in Europe, reflecting ongoing debates about identity, immigration, and the role of the nationstate in a globalized world.\\n\\nDo you think theyd be good for the United Kingdom?',\n",

It is generally characterized by its nationalist and rightwing populist ideologies. The party advocates for policies that emphasize British sovereignty, immigration control, and a return to traditional values.\\n\\nThe NRP typically focuses on issues such as promoting the interests of British citizens, criticizing the influence of the European Union, and opposing multiculturalism, which they believe undermines national identity. The party has also expressed concerns about social issues, advocating for a strong law and order approach.\\n\\nWhile the NRP aims to resonate with voters who feel disillusioned with mainstream politics, it has faced criticism for its views, which some label as extremist or xenophobic. The partys influence is limited compared to larger political parties, but it represents a segment of the electorate that seeks a more radical departure from the current political landscape.\\n\\nOverall, the National Rebirth Party is part of a broader trend of nationalist movements in Europe, reflecting ongoing debates about identity, immigration, and the role of the nationstate in a globalized world.\\n\\nDo you think theyd be good for the United Kingdom?', 'author': 'Nervous_Put5617', 'parent_id': None, 'children': ['mo0ad3o', 'mnzw3ue', 'mo0blkv', 'mo0447k', 'mo2mhmn']}, {'id': 'mo0ad3o', 'text': 'My thoughts?

This has puzzled many observers, not least because the NRP makes little effort to broaden its support and instead offers a startlingly authoritarian raft of policies.\\n\\nFor example, the groups manifesto states that only people of British heritage or lineage would qualify for citizenship and that foreigners whose presence is harmful to the interests of the national community be expelled, without exception. Moreover, citizens who refuse to carry out their duties will be stripped of their rights.\\n\\nThe death penalty would be handed to those who commit the most serious crimes, including crimes against the nation and its people, a category would include those who carry out crimes that cause direct or indirect harm to enormous numbers of people including habitual lowlevel crime.\\n\\nSource httpshopenothate.org.uk20241108nationalrebirthpartydeadonarrival', 'author': 'Solid_Psychology5453', 'parent_id': '1k2ts52', 'children': []}, {'id': 'mo0447k', 'text': 'I have never heard of them and think they will be irrelevant all of their existence.

        "text_comment = \"Starting in the 1920's the Democratic Party's big tent pole issues revolved around labor rights and support of unions. By the 1960's, successful legislation outlining workers rights, occupational safety standards, a minimum wage and environmental working conditions, had increasingly made that focus feel less urgent, letting civil rights become the predominant issue for the party. Since then, the party has become a coalition of varied interests (climate change, reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, etc.) and lacks a unifying issue to coalesce the party. This leaves them squabbling over the direction of the party, in every election cycle, with the centrist establishment usually holding sway, while the more progressive members become increasingly dissatisfied and uncooperative with party goals. The Republican Party has changed more from two single inflection points, then through slow modulation over time. The first being Nixon's Southern Strategy, which was to employ racist dog-whistle rhetoric to lure traditional Democratic voters in the South, the Dixiecrats, into the Republican fold. Around the same time, they adopted an anti-abortion stance (which had previously not been a big political issue) in order to lure traditionally Democratic Catholic voters into the GOP (having the unusual side result of Protestant Christians adopting their views on an issue from their political leaders, rather than the other way around). The second one was Trump. He has remade the Republican Party into the Trump party, and he rules over it in an openly authoritarian manner. The GOP has become more authoritarian in response and hence more cohesive in their voting habits, as demonstrating loyalty to Donald Trump is more important than maintaining a consistent political stance on any given issue. You see this contradiction with Trump spending a decade demeaning and rejecting electric vehicles, then doing a sales advert on the White House South Lawn, pushing electric vehicles. His supporters go along with this, because authoritarian structures demand conformity. Given the very different ideological structure of these two parties, it becomes difficult for them to even have a dialog about policies for the US. One side is inclined to argue, bicker and fight, but also feels obligated to let even the smallest, most marginalized voices be heard (even if they then ignore those voices). The other side is beholden to a single authority sitting at the peak of a top-down power structure. Their very understanding of who has power and how to wield it, is diametrically opposed. This makes it difficult for them to even agree on a framework for discussion, let alone a consensus on policy. **TL/DR:** Republicans value conformity and authority, making it more likely they fall in line to the leaders goals, but also more likely to support bad policy, just to demonstrate loyalty. They also embrace one large issue as uniting (currently it's immigration). Democrats value inclusion and consensus, making their internal functions more fractious, messy and less likely to arrive at a unifying policy decision. They were more successful when they agreed on one issue being more important than the myriad issues of their voters (as they did with Labor and then Civil rights), but less inclusive. Honestly, the Republican approach is more efficient, but also more likely to harm marginalized groups and damage the function of government (which is supposed to be a consensus, not just obedience). But the Democrats approach is very difficult to corral into sensible policy goals. The dems would be wise to choose a tent pole issue, like healthcare or wealth inequality, even if it costs them some of their fringe elements.\"\n",
