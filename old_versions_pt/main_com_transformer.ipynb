Chris Jacobs, one of the Republicans who voted in favor of the assault weapons ban, felt compelled to not seek reelection after facing backlash for voting in favor of gun control. httpswww.usatoday.comstorynewspolitics20220730congressmembersbrokepartyassaultweaponsban10191151002httpswww.usatoday.comstorynewspolitics20220730congressmembersbrokepartyassaultweaponsban10191151002 I understand that when it comes to being on a federal level legislature, too many dissenting voices can cause unnecessary gridlock for key legislation. **However, I feel like politics these days has given us the choice between two different sandwiches with some unsavory ingredients, and we are rarely given the option of removing or switching ingredients within the sandwich we have to take the sandwich as is. Maybe South Park was right about our only viable political options being a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Its like the two political parties know this and have convinced a lot of people that The worst person in our political party is better than the best person in the other political party.** So should there be more people and politicians willing to publicly disagree with their preferred political party on controversial issues?',\n",

              "  'text': 'Starting in the 1920s the Democratic Partys big tent pole issues revolved around labor rights and support of unions. By the 1960s, successful legislation outlining workers rights, occupational safety standards, a minimum wage and environmental working conditions, had increasingly made that focus feel less urgent, letting civil rights become the predominant issue for the party. Since then, the party has become a coalition of varied interests climate change, reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, etc. and lacks a unifying issue to coalesce the party. This leaves them squabbling over the direction of the party, in every election cycle, with the centrist establishment usually holding sway, while the more progressive members become increasingly dissatisfied and uncooperative with party goals. The Republican Party has changed more from two single inflection points, then through slow modulation over time. The first being Nixons Southern Strategy, which was to employ racist dogwhistle rhetoric to lure traditional Democratic voters in the South, the Dixiecrats, into the Republican fold. Around the same time, they adopted an antiabortion stance which had previously not been a big political issue in order to lure traditionally Democratic Catholic voters into the GOP having the unusual side result of Protestant Christians adopting their views on an issue from their political leaders, rather than the other way around. The second one was Trump. He has remade the Republican Party into the Trump party, and he rules over it in an openly authoritarian manner. The GOP has become more authoritarian in response and hence more cohesive in their voting habits, as demonstrating loyalty to Donald Trump is more important than maintaining a consistent political stance on any given issue. You see this contradiction with Trump spending a decade demeaning and rejecting electric vehicles, then doing a sales advert on the White House South Lawn, pushing electric vehicles. His supporters go along with this, because authoritarian structures demand conformity. Given the very different ideological structure of these two parties, it becomes difficult for them to even have a dialog about policies for the US. One side is inclined to argue, bicker and fight, but also feels obligated to let even the smallest, most marginalized voices be heard even if they then ignore those voices. The other side is beholden to a single authority sitting at the peak of a topdown power structure. Their very understanding of who has power and how to wield it, is diametrically opposed. This makes it difficult for them to even agree on a framework for discussion, let alone a consensus on policy. **TLDR** Republicans value conformity and authority, making it more likely they fall in line to the leaders goals, but also more likely to support bad policy, just to demonstrate loyalty. They also embrace one large issue as uniting currently its immigration. Democrats value inclusion and consensus, making their internal functions more fractious, messy and less likely to arrive at a unifying policy decision. They were more successful when they agreed on one issue being more important than the myriad issues of their voters as they did with Labor and then Civil rights, but less inclusive. Honestly, the Republican approach is more efficient, but also more likely to harm marginalized groups and damage the function of government which is supposed to be a consensus, not just obedience. But the Democrats approach is very difficult to corral into sensible policy goals. The dems would be wise to choose a tent pole issue, like healthcare or wealth inequality, even if it costs them some of their fringe elements.',\n",

It seems like the the American two party system has evolved into such a way where each side has picked what side of an issue they fall onto and they demand almost undying loyalty of their members to everything in the platform. I think a great example of this is how the two main US political parties treat those within their own party who buck party lines regarding gun control. Of the just over 400 members of the House of Representatives that voted on an assault weapons ban in 2022, only 7 of those who voted bucked party lines, 5 Democrats and 2 Republicans to be specific. Chris Jacobs, one of the Republicans who voted in favor of the assault weapons ban, felt compelled to not seek reelection after facing backlash for voting in favor of gun control.

              "  'text': 'Starting in the 1920\\'s the Democratic Party\\'s big tent pole issues revolved around labor rights and support of unions. By the 1960\\'s, successful legislation outlining workers rights, occupational safety standards, a minimum wage and environmental working conditions, had increasingly made that focus feel less urgent, letting civil rights become the predominant issue for the party. Since then, the party has become a coalition of varied interests (climate change, reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, etc.) and lacks a unifying issue to coalesce the party. This leaves them squabbling over the direction of the party, in every election cycle, with the centrist establishment usually holding sway, while the more progressive members become increasingly dissatisfied and uncooperative with party goals. The Republican Party has changed more from two single inflection points, then through slow modulation over time. The first being Nixon\\'s \"Southern Strategy\", which was to employ racist dog-whistle rhetoric to lure traditional Democratic voters in the South, the \"Dixiecrats\", into the Republican fold. Around the same time, they adopted an anti-abortion stance (which had previously not been a big political issue) in order to lure traditionally Democratic Catholic voters into the GOP (having the unusual side result of Protestant Christians adopting their views on an issue from their political leaders, rather than the other way around). The second one was Trump. He has remade the Republican Party into the Trump party, and he rules over it in an openly authoritarian manner. The GOP has become more authoritarian in response and hence more cohesive in their voting habits, as demonstrating loyalty to Donald Trump is more important than maintaining a consistent political stance on any given issue. You see this contradiction with Trump spending a decade demeaning and rejecting electric vehicles, then doing a sales advert on the White House South Lawn, pushing electric vehicles. His supporters go along with this, because authoritarian structures demand conformity. Given the very different ideological structure of these two parties, it becomes difficult for them to even have a dialog about policies for the US. One side is inclined to argue, bicker and fight, but also feels obligated to let even the smallest, most marginalized voices be heard (even if they then ignore those voices). The other side is beholden to a single authority sitting at the peak of a top-down power structure. Their very understanding of who has power and how to wield it, is diametrically opposed. This makes it difficult for them to even agree on a framework for discussion, let alone a consensus on policy. **TL/DR:** Republicans value conformity and authority, making it more likely they fall in line to the leaders goals, but also more likely to support bad policy, just to demonstrate loyalty. They also embrace one large issue as uniting (currently it\\'s immigration). Democrats value inclusion and consensus, making their internal functions more fractious, messy and less likely to arrive at a unifying policy decision. They were more successful when they agreed on one issue being more important than the myriad issues of their voters (as they did with Labor and then Civil rights), but less inclusive. Honestly, the Republican approach is more efficient, but also more likely to harm marginalized groups and damage the function of government (which is supposed to be a consensus, not just obedience). But the Democrats approach is very difficult to corral into sensible policy goals. The dems would be wise to choose a tent pole issue, like healthcare or wealth inequality, even if it costs them some of their fringe elements.',\n",

GOP - The MAGA populists and their Christian nationalist cousins are numerous enough that they can dominate the Republican party. There are also enough of them that the party can\\'t win elections without them. The establishment conservatives have the option of either bailing out or else remaining on board even though they are no longer leading the party. Most have chosen to stay, in part because they don\\'t have many areas in which they disagree (immigration and free trade). Democrats - The situation for them is not the same. Progressives comprise a small bloc within the party, yet taint the branding to the point that it causes the party to lose elections. Jonathan Chait in The Atlantic: >The ongoing influence of the (progressive) groups can be seen in a new New York Times poll. **Asked to list their top priorities, respondents cited, in order, the economy, health care, immigration, taxes, and crime.** ***Asked what they believed Democrats’ priorities were, they cited abortion, LGBTQ policy, climate change, the state of democracy, and health care.*** That perception of the party’s priorities may not be an accurate description of the views of its elected officials. But *it is absolutely an accurate description of the priorities of progressive activist groups.* >[https://www.yahoo.com/news/democrats-show-why-lost-234012734.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/democrats-show-why-lost-234012734.html) According to the More In Common survey, only 8% of the country is \"progressive populist\". According to Pew Research, only 6% of the country is \"progressive left.\" >**The electorate continues to have more voters who call themselves conservative than call themselves liberal.** About a quarter of voters say they are liberal (16%) or very liberal (8%), while 37% say they are conservative (26%) or very conservative (10%). >Almost four-in-ten voters say they are moderate (36%). >These shares are little changed since 2019. >The Republican coalition is overwhelmingly conservative: 49% of Republican-aligned voters say they are conservative and 20% say they are very conservative. About three-in-ten GOP voters say they are moderate (27%), and there are very few liberal identifiers in the party (less than 5%). >**The Democratic coalition is more ideologically mixed than the Republican coalition.** Among voters who associate with the Democrats, about half say they are very liberal (16%) or **liberal (31%)**, while nearly as many say they are **moderate (45%). Around 6% say they are conservative.** >[https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/the-changing-demographic-composition-of-voters-and-party-coalitions/](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/the-changing-demographic-composition-of-voters-and-party-coalitions/) What the Democrats need is a Sister Souljah moment or two so that moderate and conservative voters who are inclined to vote for Democrats choose to return to the party instead of sitting on the sidelines. Dems need to maintain a big tent and are dependent upon winning landslide margins and high voter turnout from minority voters, who are on the whole less liberal and less secular than white Democrats. And yet the progressive wing is dominated by educated whites who have fooled themselves into believing that they speak for minorities who they are presume are also progressive: >**a plurality of black Democratic voters have consistently identified themselves as moderate.** In 2019, about four-in-ten black Democratic voters called themselves moderate, while smaller shares described their views as liberal (29%) or conservative (25%). By contrast, 37% of Hispanic and 55% of white Democratic voters identified as liberal... >...**large majorities of black Democrats affiliate with a religion, and they are more likely than other Democrats to say they attend religious services regularly.** >[https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/02/27/5-facts-about-black-democrats/](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/02/27/5-facts-about-black-democrats/)',\n",

I think a great example of this is how the two main US political parties treat those within their own party who buck party lines regarding gun control. Of the just over 400 members of the House of Representatives that voted on an assault weapons ban in 2022, only 7 of those who voted bucked party lines, 5 Democrats and 2 Republicans to be specific. Chris Jacobs, one of the Republicans who voted in favor of the assault weapons ban, felt compelled to not seek reelection after facing backlash for voting in favor of gun control.\\n\\nhttpswww.usatoday.comstorynewspolitics20220730congressmembersbrokepartyassaultweaponsban10191151002httpswww.usatoday.comstorynewspolitics20220730congressmembersbrokepartyassaultweaponsban10191151002\\n\\nI understand that when it comes to being on a federal level legislature, too many dissenting voices can cause unnecessary gridlock for key legislation.\\n\\n**However, I feel like politics these days has given us the choice between two different sandwiches with some unsavory ingredients, and we are rarely given the option of removing or switching ingredients within the sandwich we have to take the sandwich as is. Maybe South Park was right about our only viable political options being a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Its like the two political parties know this and have convinced a lot of people that The worst person in our political party is better than the best person in the other political party.**\\n\\nSo should there be more people and politicians willing to publicly disagree with their preferred political party on controversial issues?', 'author': 'semiwadcutter38', 'parent_id': None, 'children': ['mlidiqn', 'mljxrli', 'mljrjc6', 'mligsrf', 'mlp89xi', 'mmt3sht', 'mljr5wb']}, {'id': 'mlidiqn', 'text': 'The American people are extremely divided, and typically fall pretty neatly along party lines at least more so than at other times in history. Given this, I dont think its that surprising to see our politicians reflect the characteristics of the people they represent.', 'author': 'ryan_770', 'parent_id': '1jrwfea', 'children': ['mlk9idd', 'mljlb76']}, {'id': 'mljxrli', 'text': 'Starting in the 1920s the Democratic Partys big tent pole issues revolved around labor rights and support of unions. By the 1960s, successful legislation outlining workers rights, occupational safety standards, a minimum wage and environmental working conditions, had increasingly made that focus feel less urgent, letting civil rights become the predominant issue for the party. Since then, the party has become a coalition of varied interests climate change, reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, etc. and lacks a unifying issue to coalesce the party. This leaves them squabbling over the direction of the party, in every election cycle, with the centrist establishment usually holding sway, while the more progressive members become increasingly dissatisfied and uncooperative with party goals.\\n\\nThe Republican Party has changed more from two single inflection points, then through slow modulation over time. The first being Nixons Southern Strategy, which was to employ racist dogwhistle rhetoric to lure traditional Democratic voters in the South, the Dixiecrats, into the Republican fold. Around the same time, they adopted an antiabortion stance which had previously not been a big political issue in order to lure traditionally Democratic Catholic voters into the GOP having the unusual side result of Protestant Christians adopting their views on an issue from their political leaders, rather than the other way around.\\n\\nThe second one was Trump. He has remade the Republican Party into the Trump party, and he rules over it in an openly authoritarian manner. The GOP has become more authoritarian in response and hence more cohesive in their voting habits, as demonstrating loyalty to Donald Trump is more important than maintaining a consistent political stance on any given issue. You see this contradiction with Trump spending a decade demeaning and rejecting electric vehicles, then doing a sales advert on the White House South Lawn, pushing electric vehicles. His supporters go along with this, because authoritarian structures demand conformity.\\n\\nGiven the very different ideological structure of these two parties, it becomes difficult for them to even have a dialog about policies for the US. One side is inclined to argue, bicker and fight, but also feels obligated to let even the smallest, most marginalized voices be heard even if they then ignore those voices. The other side is beholden to a single authority sitting at the peak of a topdown power structure. Their very understanding of who has power and how to wield it, is diametrically opposed. This makes it difficult for them to even agree on a framework for discussion, let alone a consensus on policy.\\n\\n**TLDR** Republicans value conformity and authority, making it more likely they fall in line to the leaders goals, but also more likely to support bad policy, just to demonstrate loyalty. They also embrace one large issue as uniting currently its immigration.

        "text_comment = \"Starting in the 1920's the Democratic Party's big tent pole issues revolved around labor rights and support of unions. By the 1960's, successful legislation outlining workers rights, occupational safety standards, a minimum wage and environmental working conditions, had increasingly made that focus feel less urgent, letting civil rights become the predominant issue for the party. Since then, the party has become a coalition of varied interests (climate change, reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, etc.) and lacks a unifying issue to coalesce the party. This leaves them squabbling over the direction of the party, in every election cycle, with the centrist establishment usually holding sway, while the more progressive members become increasingly dissatisfied and uncooperative with party goals. The Republican Party has changed more from two single inflection points, then through slow modulation over time. The first being Nixon's Southern Strategy, which was to employ racist dog-whistle rhetoric to lure traditional Democratic voters in the South, the Dixiecrats, into the Republican fold. Around the same time, they adopted an anti-abortion stance (which had previously not been a big political issue) in order to lure traditionally Democratic Catholic voters into the GOP (having the unusual side result of Protestant Christians adopting their views on an issue from their political leaders, rather than the other way around). The second one was Trump. He has remade the Republican Party into the Trump party, and he rules over it in an openly authoritarian manner. The GOP has become more authoritarian in response and hence more cohesive in their voting habits, as demonstrating loyalty to Donald Trump is more important than maintaining a consistent political stance on any given issue. You see this contradiction with Trump spending a decade demeaning and rejecting electric vehicles, then doing a sales advert on the White House South Lawn, pushing electric vehicles. His supporters go along with this, because authoritarian structures demand conformity. Given the very different ideological structure of these two parties, it becomes difficult for them to even have a dialog about policies for the US. One side is inclined to argue, bicker and fight, but also feels obligated to let even the smallest, most marginalized voices be heard (even if they then ignore those voices). The other side is beholden to a single authority sitting at the peak of a top-down power structure. Their very understanding of who has power and how to wield it, is diametrically opposed. This makes it difficult for them to even agree on a framework for discussion, let alone a consensus on policy. **TL/DR:** Republicans value conformity and authority, making it more likely they fall in line to the leaders goals, but also more likely to support bad policy, just to demonstrate loyalty. They also embrace one large issue as uniting (currently it's immigration). Democrats value inclusion and consensus, making their internal functions more fractious, messy and less likely to arrive at a unifying policy decision. They were more successful when they agreed on one issue being more important than the myriad issues of their voters (as they did with Labor and then Civil rights), but less inclusive. Honestly, the Republican approach is more efficient, but also more likely to harm marginalized groups and damage the function of government (which is supposed to be a consensus, not just obedience). But the Democrats approach is very difficult to corral into sensible policy goals. The dems would be wise to choose a tent pole issue, like healthcare or wealth inequality, even if it costs them some of their fringe elements.\"\n",
