This question prompted in me an entire essay of a response, and even if no one else reads it, it was still a good time working through my thoughts.\\n\\nIMO, the biggest problem here is that the leading political theorists in 1787 were operating in a world prior to the development of political parties, at least as we understand them today. Factions which were the nuclei of future parties literally formed *during* the effort to form the US Constitution over certain differences in principles, which appeared to be resolved more or less with the various compromises present in the final document.\\n\\n**Historical aside**\\n\\nWhigs and Tories had been present in England since 1679, but through 1787 had been primarily defined by their support for or against James, the Duke of York as a successor to King Charles II this in turn was a reaction to the events of King Charles I and the Long Parliament, the English Civil War, the neardictatorship of Oliver Cromwell, and was essentially settled by the Glorious Revolution of 1688. So while *today* we can identify Tories and Whigs as political parties, in 1787 identifying as a Tory or a Whig was mostly about your feelings on absolute monarchism vs. representative government, with a twist of where you stand on the CatholicAnglicanProtestant axis. Tories in 1787 were generally associated with old money landed gentry and the Anglican church, while Whigs were generally associated with new money Protestant aristocrats and wealthy merchants. In the American Colonies, Whigs generally favored more autonomy, while Tories supported British rule. In 1787, most Tories regardless of where they were would not have been particularly keen on revising the dominant political system of the day, and so the very prompt by OP more or less automatically assumes that to undertake designing a system of electing a President in 1787 marks one as a Whig. From here on, Ill assume that we *dont* want a President that is an absolute monarch in all but name.\\n\\n**end of aside**\\n\\nAn unstated assumption of the question is that there would be a President *at all*, as opposed to something like a Prime Minister stemming from a conjoined legislativeexecutive body such as the English Parliament. If were electing a President, and if that President is more than merely ceremonial, then we must be operating in a system where legislative and executive power are *intentionally split*, which in turn suggests that were already assuming that those two entities are set up in opposition at some level be it oversight, counterbalance, split duties, or even one body being completely subservient to the other.\\n\\nThis is where political parties come in. If we have a system where the legislative and executive entities each have some ability to counteract the powers of the other, were hoping that *when they do so* they choose to exercise that power for the good of the country and its people and not for their personal benefit after all, the whole point of splitting up power is to prevent a single powerful person or body from wielding that power in ways that are bad, however we might define that in 1787.\\n\\nPolitical parties break this dynamic. Parties allow individuals *across* the different branches of government to collude to their mutual benefit, choosing *not* to use their counterbalancing power and instead work to the benefit of the party over the good of the country. Further, parties concentrate political influence over the political process itself not merely its outcomes such that individuals *outside* of a party who might be informed by motivations such as honor or altruism are hindered from gaining office or using their individual power contrary to the interests of the party. While party *affiliation* is a helpful shorthand for ones political views, intraparty *coordination* is essentially an attempt to reconsolidate the power that had been intentionally spread across branches of government.\\n\\nAgain, this is not really understood or easily predicted in 1787. We dont really start to see political theorists start to see the problem with parties until 17961800 when a genuine dispute for leadership of political power in the United States begins, and it takes another several decades for politicians to understand and refine the power of the party and for cultural norms to shift away from nonpartisan honor and toward partisan identification.\\n\\nSo in the absence of the specific knowledge of how damaging political parties can be to a political system of separated powers, the best we would probably be able to do in 1787 would be to try and counterbalance power along two different axes from centralized Federal to decentralized local, and across the Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary. This is moreorless exactly what the Constitutional Convention of 1787 tried to do.\\n\\nFor the question of the Presidency itself, we *can* predict that regardless of how much power we allocate to the office in a *de jure* sense, the actual power of the office in a *de facto* sense would be likely to change over time we could already see this in 1787 with strong and weak ministers in Parliament, and even with strong and weak monarchs elsewhere. If the President is doing good for the country, theres not really much of a problem to solve even if the office has a significant amount of power the danger of the absolute monarch isnt the abstract principle of the distribution of power, its the risk of that power being used for bad clearly understood since at least The Prince, published in 1532, and debated thoroughly by other theorists in the following 250 years. So when designing the process of electing the President, the chief concern is\\n\\nHow do we avoid or remedy the problem of a President that is using their power to ends contrary to the good of the country?, and especially in the context of a situation where we already assume that their power will be at least partly constrained by the other branches of government and by decentralizedlocal power centers.\\n\\nWe therefore want to elect a President who\\n\\n1. is of good moral character, 2. who has no allegiance to entities with incentives contrary to the good of the country, and 3. who is skilled enough to utilize the power at their disposal to good ends.\\n\\nWe also know that no assessment and election process will be foolproof or futureproof, so we *also* want the ability to *remove* a President who manages to gain office despite lacking one of those key credentials, or who becomes unqualified within one of these credentials while in office.\\n\\nLets take these credentials in turn.',\n",

And obviously not every state should have the same number of votes or same weights it should be done not by state but by total population. And finally and this is just very obvious even in 1787 when would hope is you need a standardized voting system. You have to have a voting system where all the votes work kind of the same otherwise you could end up with disaster what if somebody in one States tries to push laws that while technically not in violation of the Constitution end up violating it in spirit.',\n",

They put a strict limit on how the president could have money from the state budget, a constant source of argument in Britain the Prince Regent was infamous in that era for this problem, by fixing their pay and make changes not take effect until after the next election and forbid other sources of public income for the president, this being one of the big disputes basically ever since the Magna Carta and parliament became a thing in the first place in the 13th century. They allowed the president to be legally impeached and removed from office, even being banned from public office, but also forbade Congress from acting like a court with the power to impose criminal sentences. This argument was what got England itself into hot water in 1648 and 1649 when they tried Charles I. They made appointments unable to be issued except to positions which were already created by law, and only then with the senates consent, and the Congress members couldnt be appointees.\\n\\nThe treaty making power depended on the senates consent in the first place to ratify, and the ambassadors are covered by appointments as I mentioned before. The president could be overridden with respect to vetoes which a king could not, and vetoes were pretty sparingly used for the first century of its existence until the Civil War, and even Jackson didnt issue that many vetoes. The judiciary was a completely different branch than the executive, contrast with Britain having some intertwining with the Kings Council which could act like a court in some ways, and still does even to this day believe it or not. The president had very little money for fanfare and spectacle, nor was given much of a staff at all with only a tiny bureaucracy to deal with, and didnt have much in the way of a guard which could be used like a secret police. The president had no power to create the rules for the military or to declare war or levy troops, that was done by Congress, and the president had very limited powers to use the military or militia on their own authority back then.\\n\\nIt wasnt completely absurd for them to think they had solved the problem, especially in combination with inventing an election system they should would avoid the previous problems with how heads of state had been chosen up to that point. Only a natural citizen could be president, avoiding issues like the War of Spanish and Austrian Successions as well as the Glorious Revolution and the Partitions of Poland. They had prevented legal dependence on the legislature which was an issue in the state governorships at that point.

Good moral character**\\n\\nTo assess the moral character of the President, we would want the election process to include multiple opportunities for the electors to assess their character. We would want to see testimonials from those we might today call character witnesses, information from multiple sources within the historical record of their prior statements and deeds, and opportunities for the candidate to express themselves directly in both assertive and reactive environments. While we might expect savvy candidates to do this organically, we would also expect those candidates to put their thumbs on the scales of how they appear to the electors, so we would ideally want an independent body to collect and distribute the relevant information and organize appearances and statements from the candidates, with the candidates themselves given the opportunity to present additional testimonials or entries from the historical record. This might be done by a branch of the Library of Congress or whatever formal records office exists in coordination with journalists.\\n\\nOn its own, this is not enough, because we also need to ensure that the electors are incentivized to assess the information critically and accurately, and to prefer candidates who are in fact of good moral character as opposed to, say, personal friends or financial benefactors. This in turn means that we need our electors to be well and broadly educated. The problem of undue influence can be partly ameliorated by expanding the group of electors as broadly as possible after all, who is a personal friend or financial benefactor to millions of people? and especially to expand the electorate to people from as many different backgrounds as possible. In 1787, these two solutions are at crosspurposes with each other, as the well educated set is relatively small. We can work to change that with a mandatory system of public education that includes philosophy, ethics, civics, history, and business, but that will take at least 1015 years to start producing newly qualified electors.\\n\\nFor now, we probably need to restrict the electors to the existing well educated set we can call these electors who have a college education the Electoral College, until we come up with a better name but well enshrine as a matter of law that adequate public education is mandatory for all residents and that graduation qualifies one for inclusion within the Electoral College. Well also need to ensure that the Electoral College is incentivized to look out for the good of *everyone* or at least their community and not just their own, elite interests, so well enshrine as a matter of law that those within the Electoral College must attend regular town meetings where all residents are given the ability to voice their concerns, and provide some sort of provision to allow residents to anonymously vote to *disqualify* individuals from participating in the Electoral College should they prove sufficiently unresponsive or dishonorable.\\n\\nSince the office of the President is a nationwide office, the vote by the Electoral College will similarly be nationwide.',\n",

The obvious risk is a President who is unduly influenced by another country or political power we can specifically outlaw this by prohibiting emoluments and titles, but what we really need is a means to *detect* undue influence and to disqualify a candidate on that basis. Requiring a President to be a nativeborn resident is a good start, but well also want to require a candidate for the office to have *never* held office or title in another country, nor anyone in their family. We may need to make some exceptions for this latter clause in 1787 for instance, in the United States many potential candidates previously held military rank or offices in colonial administration under the British government, which we probably wouldnt want to hold against them. Emoluments and other financial influence is harder to detect and define, so we should err on the side of caution here and prohibit candidates from *ever* having had business dealings or financial holdings with a foreign country except in arrangements wholly outside of their control things like a blind trust or an inheritance held prior to adulthood, verified through a robust and independent audit of their financial history. Financial audits of the candidates family should also occur, but may not be immediately disqualifying. In 1787 this will prohibit many merchants, investors, and business owners from the office. Domestic financial arrangements wont be prohibited everyone needs to buy groceries, after all.\\n\\nBut this is where the less obvious risk to deal with lies. By 1787, it is clear that financial power can be wielded politically, and there is no reason why this power couldnt be wielded domestically we can see countless examples of this in Europe as well as point to the high rate of the wealthy appearing as political notables in the United States. Looking more broadly, wealth and political power are almost synonymous throughout history and across the world, so we need to ensure that the domestically wealthy do not unduly influence the President and that the President is not themselves allegiant to their own wealth over the good of the country.\\n\\nTo this end, we should remove the President from the matter of their own finances entirely. Upon election, their personal finances become the property of the countrys general treasury, and they lose the ability to conduct financial interactions of any kind instead they have a generous lifestyle provided for them until their death at the expense of the general treasury.\\n\\nThe actual process of candidacy should also be free of financial influence so as to avoid a President being indebted to a generous financial backer during their candidacy, so the entire candidate process should be funded by the general treasury, with strict penalties for outside expenditures in support of or against a candidacy.\\n\\nTo avoid dynastic consideration and financial incentives being applied to a Presidents family, we should also prohibit candidates whose ancestors have been President this wont be a problem in 1787, and as the pool of qualified candidates grows via mandatory education, shouldnt unduly restrict our options in the future.',\n",

Skilled at utilizing the power of the office**\\n\\nThis is the hardest qualification to address prior to the candidate actually taking office in 1787 we have plenty of historical examples of people being elevated to positions they proved woefully inadequate for. Ultimately this probably will be up to the Electoral College to assess of candidates based on much of the same evidence and testimonials they rely on to assess moral character. However, we may be able to aid the assessment through a more formal process of interviewing candidates. This could take the form of providing open ended questions of how they would deal with hypotheticals as President, or how they would have handled past events differently from the President at the time. Well need to decide on things like how many questions should be asked, how much time the interview process should take, how to decide on which questions to be asked, but in general this process should be deliberative and measured to ensure that sober and thoughtful answers are provided. Once again we can probably lean on experts within the Library of Congress and journalists to help with historical and contemporary hypotheticals, as well as from within the Legislature and Judiciary for hypotheticals within the law, and perhaps also a specially elected group of nongovernmental vox populi to ensure that questions are asked from the general electorate that are relevant to the issues of the day.\\n\\nA candidates previous history is likely to influence the Electoral Colleges assessment at this stage, but it is difficult to predict what past experiences might lend themselves to future success. A former provincial governor has obvious qualifications, but so too might a prominent religious leader, a military officer, a university dean, or a town councilmember. While the scope of their previous duties is relevant, there is no scope so large as President, so all previous duties will be insufficient preparation in some measure, and thus there should be no requirement on specific previous experience. That said, the Electoral Colleges assessment is likely to heavily favor experiences of *leadership* in particular, and would do well to distinguish that particular experience from the lesser experiences of ownership, management, or authority this last point can be aided via the interview process.\\n\\nIt is probably impossible to develop a way of assessing a persons natural *ability* to use the power of the office, since there are probably many variations on how a skillful holder of the office would perform and especially as we consider how the powers of the office might evolve over time. But we can assess a persons likelihood to be able to use the power of the office *at all*, at least medically speaking, so a thorough medical examination to assess a candidates good health and physical and mental fortitude to withstand the demands of the office should be required.\\n\\nOf course, in order to skillfully use the the office, a President will require a reasonable certainty of a suitable length of time to pursue projects, programs, and policies, so a term of 5 years seems reasonable to provide some stability and plenty of time to concentrate on the duties of the office. I see no reason to prohibit a President from seeking reelection at the conclusion of their term, so long as they continue to be otherwise qualified.',\n",

              "  'text': '**4. Removing an unqualified President**\\n\\nIn 1787, we are very familiar with the notion of wanting to replace the existing executive power in favor of another. No matter how well designed a political system, people will attempt to gain political power for their own selfish or illconsidered ends, and some of those attempts will succeed. And no matter how little or how much power the office of the President holds at that moment in time, a nationwide office held by a single person will inevitably wield a great amount of influence, and so we will need a remedy for the certainty of a bad President.\\n\\nIn fact, we likely need *multiple* methods of removal for a bad President, as the office is so deeply intertwined with multiple interests which all must be continuously satisfied.\\n\\nFor the Judiciary, the obvious recourse is to include removal from office as one of the potential penalties for breaking the law. Just as with any other citizen, the President must follow the law, and evidence of violations should not by excused by their office. Criminal acts might not necessarily lead to removal, but would be a significant factor for the Electoral College to consider.\\n\\nFor the Legislature, a means to remove the President from office for noncriminal reasons is needed. While the power of the Legislature and the Executive is intentionally split, there is a need for the President to faithfully execute the will of the Legislature within the boundaries of any other checks on power we might design, and a President who fails to do so ought to be investigated and potentially removed. The Legislature also has the advantage of working closely with the President on a regular basis, and is perhaps best positioned to continually assess the qualifications of the President. To that end, the Legislature should explicitly be empowered and enjoined to remove a President who fails to show good moral character, who evinces allegiance to an entity above the country, or who proves unskilled at the office none of which are necessarily crimes.\\n\\nFor the Electoral College, a means to remove a President who is no longer satisfactory is needed, as well as a means to remove a President who by some means has stymied the ability of the Judiciary or the Legislative to rightfully remove them from office. The Electoral College needs no better reason for removal than the simple desire of its occurrence, though of course as this process is considered by the electorate the cry will be raised from many corners to carefully consider the risks of hasty or undue disruption of the office. This can take two forms the Electoral College can call for a new election to interrupt the existing term of the President, and the Electoral College can call for the immediate removal of the President in favor of a caretaker officeholder while new elections are held. The Electoral College can also call for an inquest to force the President to answer questions on their conduct or their policies, which may lead to removal.\\n\\nA President who is removed by any of these means would no longer have their generous lifestyle provided for by the treasury, and in this event would have their previous financial holdings returned to them. A President who voluntarily resigns may retain their provided lifestyle but depending on their acts as President, may find consequences from other actors. The risk of ignominy and loss of financial security will encourage Presidents to not overstay their time in office and risk being deemed unskilled.\\n\\nIn support of all of these oversight mechanisms, the financial audit performed on all candidates and their families will be regularly repeated on the sitting President at least annually, and more frequently if demanded by the Legislature or Judiciary. So too will the medical assessment of the President be repeated at least annually, or more frequently if demanded by the Legislature or Judiciary. While the President will not need to interview annually, at least not fully and formally, the Electoral College will retain the ability to ask questions of the President via the vox populi and other means, and the President ignores those questions at their peril.',\n",

That did work in the cases before 2019, but Netanyahu became investigated personally for corruption, and is still the leader of Likud. This made many of the parties that Likud would normally have been OK negotiating with unwilling to do so, and so left the remaining options either dissolve or form a coalition with parties he would not have done ordinarily, or at least if they did, their much more controversial policies would have been less likely to pass as Likud would have had the option to try to treat with centrist and centre left groups too.\\n\\nThe Knesset should have an odd number, probably about 50 more seats at least given the population of Israel, should have a zipper list for men and women especially if they use closed lists, which also would annoy ultranationalist parties and force them to adapt, and if they have an election and a deadlock, fail to elect a prime minister, and fail again to pick a new prime minister, they should have a runoff to pick a new prime minister having eliminated last place and vote again. Oh, and make the threshold to dissolve at other times need 23 of the Knesset to agree, probably needing say a third of the MPs to even demand the vote take place for the speaker to put it on the agenda.',\n",

This question prompted in me an entire essay of a response, and even if no one else reads it, it was still a good time working through my thoughts.\\n\\nIMO, the biggest problem here is that the leading political theorists in 1787 were operating in a world prior to the development of political parties, at least as we understand them today. Factions which were the nuclei of future parties literally formed *during* the effort to form the US Constitution over certain differences in principles, which appeared to be resolved more or less with the various compromises present in the final document.\\n\\n**Historical aside**\\n\\nWhigs and Tories had been present in England since 1679, but through 1787 had been primarily defined by their support for or against James, the Duke of York as a successor to King Charles II this in turn was a reaction to the events of King Charles I and the Long Parliament, the English Civil War, the neardictatorship of Oliver Cromwell, and was essentially settled by the Glorious Revolution of 1688. So while *today* we can identify Tories and Whigs as political parties, in 1787 identifying as a Tory or a Whig was mostly about your feelings on absolute monarchism vs. representative government, with a twist of where you stand on the CatholicAnglicanProtestant axis. Tories in 1787 were generally associated with old money landed gentry and the Anglican church, while Whigs were generally associated with new money Protestant aristocrats and wealthy merchants. In the American Colonies, Whigs generally favored more autonomy, while Tories supported British rule. In 1787, most Tories regardless of where they were would not have been particularly keen on revising the dominant political system of the day, and so the very prompt by OP more or less automatically assumes that to undertake designing a system of electing a President in 1787 marks one as a Whig. From here on, Ill assume that we *dont* want a President that is an absolute monarch in all but name.\\n\\n**end of aside**\\n\\nAn unstated assumption of the question is that there would be a President *at all*, as opposed to something like a Prime Minister stemming from a conjoined legislativeexecutive body such as the English Parliament. If were electing a President, and if that President is more than merely ceremonial, then we must be operating in a system where legislative and executive power are *intentionally split*, which in turn suggests that were already assuming that those two entities are set up in opposition at some level be it oversight, counterbalance, split duties, or even one body being completely subservient to the other.\\n\\nThis is where political parties come in. If we have a system where the legislative and executive entities each have some ability to counteract the powers of the other, were hoping that *when they do so* they choose to exercise that power for the good of the country and its people and not for their personal benefit after all, the whole point of splitting up power is to prevent a single powerful person or body from wielding that power in ways that are bad, however we might define that in 1787.\\n\\nPolitical parties break this dynamic. Parties allow individuals *across* the different branches of government to collude to their mutual benefit, choosing *not* to use their counterbalancing power and instead work to the benefit of the party over the good of the country. Further, parties concentrate political influence over the political process itself not merely its outcomes such that individuals *outside* of a party who might be informed by motivations such as honor or altruism are hindered from gaining office or using their individual power contrary to the interests of the party. While party *affiliation* is a helpful shorthand for ones political views, intraparty *coordination* is essentially an attempt to reconsolidate the power that had been intentionally spread across branches of government.\\n\\nAgain, this is not really understood or easily predicted in 1787. We dont really start to see political theorists start to see the problem with parties until 17961800 when a genuine dispute for leadership of political power in the United States begins, and it takes another several decades for politicians to understand and refine the power of the party and for cultural norms to shift away from nonpartisan honor and toward partisan identification.\\n\\nSo in the absence of the specific knowledge of how damaging political parties can be to a political system of separated powers, the best we would probably be able to do in 1787 would be to try and counterbalance power along two different axes from centralized Federal to decentralized local, and across the Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary. This is moreorless exactly what the Constitutional Convention of 1787 tried to do.\\n\\nFor the question of the Presidency itself, we *can* predict that regardless of how much power we allocate to the office in a *de jure* sense, the actual power of the office in a *de facto* sense would be likely to change over time we could already see this in 1787 with strong and weak ministers in Parliament, and even with strong and weak monarchs elsewhere. If the President is doing good for the country, theres not really much of a problem to solve even if the office has a significant amount of power the danger of the absolute monarch isnt the abstract principle of the distribution of power, its the risk of that power being used for bad clearly understood since at least The Prince, published in 1532, and debated thoroughly by other theorists in the following 250 years. So when designing the process of electing the President, the chief concern is\\n\\nHow do we avoid or remedy the problem of a President that is using their power to ends contrary to the good of the country?, and especially in the context of a situation where we already assume that their power will be at least partly constrained by the other branches of government and by decentralizedlocal power centers.\\n\\nWe therefore want to elect a President who\\n\\n1. is of good moral character, 2. who has no allegiance to entities with incentives contrary to the good of the country, and 3. who is skilled enough to utilize the power at their disposal to good ends.\\n\\nWe also know that no assessment and election process will be foolproof or futureproof, so we *also* want the ability to *remove* a President who manages to gain office despite lacking one of those key credentials, or who becomes unqualified within one of these credentials while in office.\\n\\nLets take these credentials in turn.')\n",

And finally and this is just very obvious even in 1787 when would hope is you need a standardized voting system. You have to have a voting system where all the votes work kind of the same otherwise you could end up with disaster what if somebody in one States tries to push laws that while technically not in violation of the Constitution end up violating it in spirit.')\n",
