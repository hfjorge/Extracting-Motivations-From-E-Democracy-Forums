I’m not sold on the “sleek” design. 
It feels too cold and generic to me, and the agressive architecture isn't always too wellcoming.
I was hoping for something that reflects our city’s character more. 
Still, I’m glad the environmental side is being handled well, and I’m curious about the transit plans too.
