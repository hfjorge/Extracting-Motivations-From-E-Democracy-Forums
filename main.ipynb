              "  'text': 'This post is speculative and is not intended to fearmonger.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump has stated that he has an attack plan ready for Irans nuclear enrichment facility and will decide within the next two weeks whether to authorize a strike. Israel supposedly needs the U.S. to carry out the strike because it lacks the bunkerbuster bomb and other equipment necessary to destroy the facility on its own. A U.S. strike could be the firstand possibly the lastdirect military action against Irans nuclear infrastructure, or it could be the event that triggers a larger regional war. Depending on how Iran and its allies respond, any strike could escalate tensions in the region and potentially draw in other Western allies alongside the U.S. and Israel.\\n\\nIf the situation in Iran spirals into a larger conflict, it raises the question could this instability open the door for China to make a move on Taiwan? China has been vocal about its goal of reclaiming Taiwan and has ramped up military pressure on the island in recent years. Taiwan also plays a critical role in the global economy due to its dominance in semiconductor manufacturing. Given Western reliance on Taiwans semiconductor industryand the fact that Taiwan is a democracydo you think we could see direct NATO combat assistance in the event of a Chinese invasion?\\n\\nWith all that said, could broader conflict in the Middle East or East Asia push NATO toward deeper involvement in Ukraine? While NATO has provided extensive military and financial aid, it has been reluctant to deploy troops in order to avoid a larger war. But if other conflicts involving Western interests were to erupt, could this chain reaction lead to direct involvement in Ukraine as well?\\n\\nAt what point do the flashpoints in Iran, Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine begin to resemble the kind of global alignment that historically preceded world wars? The transition from World War I to World War II involved a cascading series of alliances, territorial changes, and ideological clashes. The collapse of the Ottoman Empire during WWI led to British control of Palestine, and the British issued the Balfour Declaration, which expressed support for the establishment of a home for the Jewish people in Palestine. After WWII, the global power structure shifted, and the U.S. and Britain supported the creation of Israel as a safe haven for Jews following the Holocaust. Since then, the modern state of Israel has remained entangled in ongoing regional conflicts that continue to draw in Western attention.\\n\\nSo, given the current state of affairs, its not unreasonable to ask Could a confrontation with Iran spark a broader geopolitical chain reaction?\\n\\nSource 1 httpswww.pbs.orgnewshourshowisraelthreatensiransupremeleaderastrumpwaversonenteringthewarhttpswww.pbs.orgnewshourshowisraelthreatensiransupremeleaderastrumpwaversonenteringthewar\\n\\nSource 2 httpswww.wsj.compoliticsnationalsecuritytrumpprivatelyapprovedattackplansforiranbuthaswithheldfinalorder4563c526?gaa_ateafsgaa_nASWzDAiJPHq6ikOwDCGgAC0JF3tz6GT2lMSYVRO3oFvrtL8_pxxuoemFgaa_ts6854a975gaa_sigsmWChJc152acZjF6fFjt3fupJ7rRWvMczixwc3DzexSqzSeBUz_fVVQOrMXPjaFxtyM1TG1woqcNJ1ujUMjg3D3Dhttpswww.wsj.compoliticsnationalsecuritytrumpprivatelyapprovedattackplansforiranbuthaswithheldfinalorder4563c526?gaa_ateafsgaa_nASWzDAiJPHq6ikOwDCGgAC0JF3tz6GT2lMSYVRO3oFvrtL8_pxxuoemFgaa_ts6854a975gaa_sigsmWChJc152acZjF6fFjt3fupJ7rRWvMczixwc3DzexSqzSeBUz_fVVQOrMXPjaFxtyM1TG1woqcNJ1ujUMjg3D3D',\n",

On the other hand, Xi would not commit Beijing to abandoning the use of force and said it would reserve the option to take any necessary measure. This threat was directed, he said, at the interference of external forces code for the United States and at an extremely small number of Taiwan independence separatists and their separatist activities.

Why would they risk that for a chance at maybe taking over an extremely defensible mountainous island of 20 million people who hate your guts and will destroy all of their semiconductor factories the moment you arrive just to spite you?\\n\\nYes, there is a large buildup of military capabilities and even naval blockades. Naturally, like any major power, they want to be unhindered by the wills of any other major power, and both internally and externally they are heavily invested in sending a strong message regarding their position on Taiwan but, and maybe Ill eat my words, and you can all point at my comment in 2031 and laugh, I dont believe the calculus is such that a rational, selfinterested CCP would ever take that risk.',\n",

A preemptive surprise attack on US and Allied forces in the Western Pacific theater.

A military invasion would follow months or years later after the blockade has attritted Taiwans ability to resist. This would probably work quite well as long as the US doesnt get involved.

They also do most of the lucrative trade with the US and EU. So there is no incentive to do anything with Iran except for oil. But if they dont do anything then they have Russia by the balls because Russia needs China buying there oil. Oh and who and closing the Straight of Hormuz? That wouldnt last beyond a couple of weeks. Saudis arent going to side with Iran they are Sunni. Iraq wont. Because Shiite and Sunni as it stands arent going to do anything to descend into war. Shia militias might but they wont do anything beyond attack Us bases. And that wont last long because they wont have the support of Iran given they have no way to coordinate anything on the top level. The bottom line here is that this situation is not going to devolve into world war 3. It is an absurd idiotic take who dont understand the players and motivations behind of them involved. Russia cant project power. China wont because they are going to benefit from this. And no one is going to save Iran. Oh btw Russian descent makes up over 20 percent of Israel population FYI. No they wont get involved. It would cause them way more issues then it is worth and they get the benefit of increased oil prices as a bonus.',\n",

If you go over to rAndor people have posted the signs I made there.\\n\\nI have worked with the ACLU and several immigration organizations on pocket cards that go over immigrant rights and what to do and how to respond to ICE. Also general use ones for use with normal police. Recently working on ones for protestors when it comes to military and national guard.\\n\\nRecently because Ive also seen the danger of disarmament in the face of fascism as well as the importance that firearms served during the Civil Rights Movements, I have started supporting groups like the SRA and the Liberal Gun Club, and reached out to Democratic politicians that are pro 2A to assist in their campaign material. Ive recently done the Pride material for the SRA that was shown on rliberalgunowners the other day.\\n\\nIn addition to all of that, we do the printing for most if not all of the Unions in the PNW, so we support unions all over.\\n\\nThats professionally, personally I have been working on public outreach for issues that are close to me like the second amendment and firearm ownership on the left as it pertains to being armed in the face of rising fascism. I have gone to many local townhalls to talk to my representatives about my opinions on it.\\n\\nI am a part of my local mutual aid group as well and provide support with flyers and print material as needed.\\n\\nI am currently working on materials for public education and outreach on gun control, and looking into starting a nonprofit around it. This includes what Im coining as a Mutual defense group which mimics the theory of mutual aid groups, but is geared more towards the mutual defense of communities, especially marginalized communities, especially as the systems in place to protect everyone equally are starting to waver.\\n\\nI have also created a subreddit called rCounterChamber, and while its just me right now, its purpose is to break the echo chamber in conservative subreddits and allow discussion of narratives and give people the opportunity to respond to comments made in flaired user only posts. As I said, its just me right now, but I still hope that it catches on. I need it to catch on with the left and have a decent userbase of left wing people before I talk about it broadly.',\n",

Thats usually what people means when they say that we know Saddam had WMDs.\\n\\nBut first, in the mid 90s Saddam did actually let the UN into Iraq after his defeat in the first Gulf War and UNSCOM destroyed effectively all of those chemical warheads. Saddams noncompliance with UN weapon inspections really only becomes a problem from 1998 onwards.\\n\\nAnd second, those chemical weapons have a shelflife and need to be stored properly in order to be functional. By 2003, the chemical weapons we sold Saddam had either been disposed of or degraded until they were useless.\\n\\nWe did find their remnants though, and not all the warheads were disposed of properly. That doesnt mean they were functional as weapons but it does mean they were a source of hazardous pollution for the military dealing with them. Thats what that NPR article is talking about the military was covering up that it was exposing US soldiers to hazardous waste from improperly disposed chemical weapons, not covering up the discovery of functional warheads.\\n\\nIt also doesnt mean that you want criminals getting their hands on the remnants maybe the corroded rockets cant be fired, maybe theyre not weapons of mass destruction anymore, but the components could still be used in a booby trap to harm a patrol.',\n",

              "  'text': 'Israel is not stupid enough to attack Turkey just for backing the Palestinian cause. If Israel wanted to attack every country for supporting Palestine, it would have a very long list of countries. Jordan directly borders Israel, has historically been far more supportive of Palestine, and was a hotspot of Palestinian terrorists prior to their expulsion after Black September, yet Israel has never attacked Jordan. Israel only cares about the security of Israel proper and by extension the West Bank and Gaza as buffer zonessettlement spaces. Turkey is not an existential threat to Israel the only country that Israel truly sees as one is Iran, which is why it seeks to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons at all costs. No other state in the region has so openly called for Israels dissolution while simultaneously funding explicit efforts towards that goal through paramilitary proxies.\\n\\nChina has its ambitions set on Taiwan and the South China Sea. However, its economy has been recently crippled by the real estate crisis and it can ill afford to exacerbate a global recession by directly joining in a Middle Eastern war that is of little relevance to them. Iran isnt the only oil exporter in the world and certainly doesnt offer enough for a historically noninterventionist China to offer its untested military in support or significant weapons exports. China will do what it does best and offer words of criticism and some token economicmilitary support, ensuring that they at the very least reap some benefits while sitting on the sidelines with the testing of their military hardware against Western tech. Any state would be foolish to count on China as a reliable ally when push comes to shove, as Chinas foreign policy is the definition of pragmatic observation and risk minimalization.',\n",

I dont really agree that deportation amounts to ethnic cleansing, particularly since the criteria is legal status, not ethnicity and the theres a broad array of nationalities being targeted, the ones of Hispanic origin are just much greater in number and get the most focus. There have been many African, European and Asian nationals deported as part of this campaign. Ethnic cleansing itself also implies an intent to erase an entire people or culture, which isnt whats happening here at all.\\n\\nI will add though that Bush *technically* created ICE, but before ICE it was the INS and it encompassed a larger role. INS was part of the DoJ and encompassed border enforcement, visas, green cards, deportations, citizenship processing etc. When the Dept of Homeland Security was created post911, INS was dissolved and broken down into USCIS, CBP and ICE, where ICEs new mandate was to focus solely on enforcement within our borders. The thought process at the time was that INS was overwhelmed and unable to doitall, so breaking up functions would allow for better focus and professionalization. Though arguably since its just created more bureaucratic bloat and limited accountability as theres no longer a single unified entity to take responsibility of the whole system. Logically youd think it would be the Dept of Homeland Security, but each agency has very different mandates, leadership structures, and overlapping goals e.g. USCIS approving a visa for someone ICE is separately targeting The entire process is fragmented across four federal departments, its a real cluster fuck.

Israel has had war plans against Iran for decades and with the collaboration of the US has been actively sabotaging Irans nuclear program with assassinations and cyberattacks. The main reason why Israel didnt first strike Iran previously is that Irans proxies would open up a multifront war in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Gaza.\\n\\nNow with Hezbollah and Hamas thoroughly degraded, Assad overthrown in Syria, and Russia bogged down after years of devastating losses in Ukraine, Israel can strike at the Iranian regime and its nuclear program with impunity. With the Trump administration being significantly more friendly to Israeli interests than the average administration, Israel knows it even more reliably has US support in its endeavors. US neoconservatives have also long saw Iran as a threat to be neutralized, and Trump is surrounded with enough neoconservatives to be persuaded to flip flop on his campaign promises of isolationism.\\n\\nIran becoming a nuclear state was always a nonstarter for Israel, with Israel being one of the notable parties against the original nuclear deal at the onset because it believed that anything short of dismantling Irans nuclear program entirely was merely delaying the inevitable case scenario where Iran would slowly build towards nukes. Strategically, this has been the best opportunity in years for Israel to get away with a first strike while having relatively little blowback. Israels international reputation may be in tatters, but Iran is not nearly sympathetic enough of a target for countries in the region to futilely throw in their lot with Iran, especially with the looming threat of the US backing Israel.\\n\\nFrom a strictly realpolitik point of view, any state with sufficient military capability would reasonably first strike a hostile regional state that attempted to go nuclear. China would do the same if Taiwan attempted to obtain nuclear weapons. The US would have boots on the ground in Cuba before the days end if Cuba announced it wanted a repeat of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Likewise, Russia would undertake another special military operation if any adversarial states in its vicinity wanted to go nuclear. North Korea is a stark lesson in the consequences of letting a hostile regional adversary obtain nuclear weapons no state with the capability to nip the problem in the bud is going to let a repeat of North Korea happen again.\\n\\nChina does not have the domestic willpower or incompetence leadership to commit untested troops to fight a losing war on behalf of Iran when it needs to marshal its strength for Taiwan and the South China Sea in the face of a slowing economy and looming demographic crisis. If it isnt even ready to invade neighboring Taiwan, then committing military action to some country 3000 miles away is an utter fantasy. Iran also isnt close enough of an ally for it to send its best and latest military hardware at best Iran is getting stuff that China does not mind being publicly analyzable by the US.\\n\\nAs for Israel attacking Lebanon and Syria, there is at least some plausibility behind it given that there are still remnants of Hezbollah and Iranbacked militia in both countries. Whether it is overkill is debatable, but there is some sense to it as opposed to something like hypothetically invading Jordan, Egypt, or Turkey countries that dont actively harbor Iranbacked paramilitaries and are fully hostile to Israel. Also, the guy who threatened to attack Pakistan is a former deputy minister of defense who isnt in politics currently. It was also in response to Irans claims that Pakistan promised to nuke Israel in retaliation if Israel uses nukes against Iran. Ironically, Pakistan immediately denied making such a promise. Pakistans government and military, for all of their faults, do not have a death wish to get into a nuclear shooting match with Israel.',\n",
